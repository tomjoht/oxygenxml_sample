      the pollen to be deposited on the pollinator. When the pollinator withdraws from the flower,
      the lever returns the stamens to their original position. As the pollinator enters another
      flower of the same species, the stigma is placed in a general location that corresponds to
      where the pollen was deposited on the pollinator's body. It is believed that this is a key
      factor in the speciation of this large group of diverse plants. However, it now appears that
      somewhat different versions of this lever mechanism have evolved in the tribe Mentheae, and
