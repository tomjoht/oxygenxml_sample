            Garden hardy mums are perennials capable of being wintered over in the ground in most
            northern latitudes. Exhibition varieties are not usually as sturdy. Garden hardies are
            defined by their ability to produce an abundance of small blooms with little if any
            mechanical assistance (ie. staking) and withstanding wind and rain. Exhibition varieties
            on the other hand require staking, over-wintering in a relatively dry cool environment,
            sometimes with the addition of night lights. </p>
